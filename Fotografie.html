      <p>I followed the Minor Photography at my school. I learned a lot during the 10 weeks I was doing it. The progress I made makes me very proud, considering I went from 0 knowledge in photography to making great pictures with my own camera. See the photobook I made in this time period below.This photography book contains 5 assignments. The first 4 were mandatory by university. The last one was a free assignment where I could choose what I would photograph myself. The topic I chose, is called: City Lights. Hereby I took pictures of the cities by night. </p>
