        <h2>Assignment</h2>
        <p>
          The assignment was to program a clock, which can show the different parts of the day. It also had to include an animation. This assignment left a lot of room for creativity and freedom. I had two weeks to make it.

        <p>
        As I was thinking about the assignment, I got the idea to make my own landscapes for this project. I love designing, so it would be a nice way to add a personal touch to this project. I got inspired by different apps where the background changes based on the weather. Instead of using the weather, I took time as an inspiration. I wasnâ€™t planning on making it all too complicated so I chose four different times: morning, afternoon, evening and night. I used one design in Adobe Illustrator and then tweaked the colors based on the time.
        See the 4 designs I made below:
